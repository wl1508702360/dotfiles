I want to make an easy understood configuration of all unix-alike OS.
Something needs to be changed.

### vim

Vim is a great editor in the universe, plus with Emacs.

Vim can read `~/.vimrc` and `~/.vim/vimrc`, so here is the thing: you just need
to copy vim directory to your $HOME and rename it to `.vim`.

Vim has so many plugins made by talented people on the web. I use *Plug* to
manage all my plugins. Now you need to install them after last step using
`:PlugInstall` inside vim editor window.
